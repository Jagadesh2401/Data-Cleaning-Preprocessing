This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship, where I cleaned and preprocessed a raw dataset using Python (Pandas) in Google Colab.
The dataset used is the Medical Appointments No-Show Dataset, publicly available on Mendeley Data:

🔗 Dataset Link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wm6w2fvkfj/1

The goal of this task was to clean the dataset by fixing missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, incorrect data types, and preparing it for analysis.

✅ Data Cleaning Steps Performed

 1️⃣ Loaded the Dataset

  Imported the raw CSV file and inspected its structure.

 2️⃣ Missing Values Handling

  Checked missing values using:

        df.isnull().sum()

  Removed rows containing nulls using:

        df.dropna()

  ✔ Final dataset contains 0 missing values.

 3️⃣ Duplicate Removal

  Checked duplicates using:

    df.duplicated().sum()


  No duplicate rows were found.

 4️⃣ Column Name Standardization

  All column names were cleaned by:

  > converting to lowercase

  > replacing spaces with underscores

  > replacing hyphens with underscores

   Example:
      Entry Service Date → entry_service_date

 5️⃣ Date Format Conversion

  Attempted conversion of all columns containing the word "day":

    pd.to_datetime(df[col], errors='coerce')


  Invalid conversions were handled safely using errors='coerce'.

 6️⃣ Fixed Data Types

  Converted valid date columns to datetime

  Ensured numeric columns had proper types

  Cleaned inconsistent text formatting

 7️⃣ Outlier Check

  Used the IQR method to find extreme values in numeric fields.

 8️⃣ Exported Clean Dataset

  Final cleaned dataset saved as:

    cleaned_medical_appointments.csv
